## Assembly Instructions

### In Video Editor (DaVinci Resolve / Premiere / Final Cut)

**Timeline Structure:**
```
00:00 - 00:08  Opening (shot_05_opening.mp4)
00:07 - 00:15  Core (shot_05_core_moment.mp4) [1s overlap with Opening]

```

**Total Duration:** 22-25 seconds (depending on overlap)

---

### Transition Points

**Opening → Core (at 7-8 seconds):**
- **Type:** Quick cut or snap zoom
- **Timing:** The moment the phone notification appears
- **Audio:** Sudden DING should punctuate the transition
- **Visual Match:** Match Alex's face position from end of Opening to start of Core

**Core → Closing (at 14-15 seconds):**
- **Type:** Smooth continuity or brief fade
- **Timing:** After the "WOO!" celebration peak
- **Audio:** Confetti sound fades into calm satisfaction
- **Visual Match:** Match Alex's smile from end of Core to start of Closing

---

## Audio Layering

### Layer 1: Voice-Over (Alex's internal monologue)
```
"2:47 PM. The store's been live for eight hours."
[Pause for phone DING and reaction]
[Live dialogue] "WOO! Someone bought one!"
[Caption appears] "That feels great."
```

### Layer 2: Ambient Sound
- Opening: Kitchen ambience, subtle movements
- Core: Phone notification DING, time-slow effect whoosh
- Closing: Settling breath, quiet satisfaction

### Layer 3: Music
- Opening: Low atmospheric build
- Core: SWELL - biggest crescendo
- Closing: Resolve to satisfied reflection

### Layer 4: Sound Effects
- Phone DING (loud, clear, at transition point)
- Time-freeze whoosh (subtle)

- Coffee cup settling (if desired)

## Editing Tips

### Pacing
- **Opening:** Slow, contemplative - let audience settle in
- **Core:** Quick cuts, snap zooms, explosive energy
- **Closing:** Return to slower pace, let emotion breathe

### Camera Movement
- All three segments have built-in camera moves
- Ensure smooth transitions between segments
- Consider adding slow-motion at the "WOO!" peak (0.5x speed for 2 seconds)

### Audio Dynamics
- Opening: -12dB (quiet, atmospheric)
- Core: 0dB (full volume, especially the DING)
- Closing: -6dB (settled but present)

---

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Comic Book Panel Borders
Add traditional comic panel borders around each segment:
- Opening: Single wide panel
- Core: 3 panels (notification, freeze, celebration)
- Closing: Single panel with caption

### 2. Motion Comic Effects
- Add subtle parallax to background elements
- Animate speech bubbles appearing with timing
- Add slight character breathing in static moments

### 3. Extended Celebration
If you need exactly 25 seconds:
- Extend the "WOO!" moment by 2-3 seconds
