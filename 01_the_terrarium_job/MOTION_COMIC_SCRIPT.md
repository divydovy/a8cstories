## Next Steps for Production

### Phase 1: Animatic (Test)
1. Take all 14 comic pages
2. Create simple animatic in editing software
3. Add temporary music + rough VO
4. Time out all shots
5. Review pacing

### Phase 2: Motion Comic Animation
**Option A: Traditional Editing**
- Use After Effects or DaVinci Resolve
- Animate each panel with camera moves
- Add subtle animations (eyes, breathing, glow)
- Composite all layers

**Option B: AI Video Generation**
- Use tools like Runway Gen-3, Pika, or Veo
- Generate animated versions of key panels
- May add more life but less control

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Use traditional editing for camera moves
- Use AI for specific animated elements (printer, data flows)
- Best of both worlds

### Phase 3: Audio Production
1. Record professional VO
2. License or create music track
3. Add sound effects
4. Mix all audio layers
5. Master final audio

### Phase 4: Final Composite
1. Render final video
2. Color grade (ensure WooCommerce purple consistency)
3. Add end card/credits
4. Export multiple formats (4K, 1080p, social media)
