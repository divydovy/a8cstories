**Time:** Day 1, Morning - 6:30 AM
**Location:** Kitchen, coffee in hand
**Mood:** The moment of transformation - blueprint becomes reality

**Visual Description:**
Person standing at kitchen counter, coffee mug in hand, looking down at phone. From phone screen, a burst of geometric light/data streams upward, forming a 3D holographic projection of a storefront/infrastructure. The projection shows interconnected nodes (payments, shipping, inventory) linking together - like an operating system booting up.

**Key Elements:**

**Mood:** Intelligence at work, the system is alive

**Visual Description:**
Person sitting at table, laptop open, looking at screen with interest. From the laptop, a network visualization extends: interconnected nodes and flowing data streams. Key nodes glow in sequence: "PRICING" → "CHANNELS" → "SHIPPING" → "SUPPLIERS". Each node pulses when activated, with connection lines flowing between them.

**Key Elements:**
- Data visualization as art
- Person as observer, not controller
- Sense of intelligent system making connections

## Technical Notes for Image Generation

### Text Handling Strategy
Since Gemini struggles with text rendering:
1. **UI screens** = Abstract glowing shapes, data flows, geometric patterns (NO readable text)
2. **Notifications** = Pulsing icons, badges, glowing indicators
3. **Dashboards** = Network visualizations, graphs with abstract data points
4. **Product labels** = Minimalist geometric logos, color coding

### Consistency Elements
Maintain across all scenes:
- Protagonist's appearance (clothing can change seasonally)
- Terrarium product design (modular cube, specific aesthetic)
- Digital elements color palette (blues/teals)
- Physical space evolution (kitchen → workspace → warehouse)

### Cinematic Considerations (for potential film adaptation)
- Each scene designed as potential key frame
- Camera angles suggest movement/progression
- Emotional beats are clear
- Visual continuity supports narrative flow

## Next Steps
1. Generate detailed prompts for each scene
2. Run prompts through Gemini Image Gen
3. Review and refine
4. Compile into final graphic novel format
