## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Visual Style Consistency
- **Color palette:** Maintain neo-noir aesthetic from original concept
- **Character design:** Alex should be consistent - casual, approachable, always with coffee
- **Tech visualization:** Keep Build's interface abstract but readable (show text in bubbles, not realistic UI)
- **Environment evolution:** Show kitchen → workspace → warehouse progression clearly

### Panel Layout Guidance
- Pages 1-4: Tighter panels (4 per page) - establishing, building momentum
- Pages 5-8: Mix of tight and wide panels - showing scale and growth
- Pages 9-12: Vary rhythm - wide establishing shots + detail close-ups
- Pages 13-15: Return to intimate scale, mirror opening pages

### Dialogue Principles
- **Alex:** Conversational, real, vulnerable but optimistic
- **Build:** Helpful but not robotic, shows intelligence naturally
- **Maya:** Grounds the story, represents the "normal person" perspective
- **Avoid:** Tech jargon, over-explanation, talking heads

### Key Emotional Beats
1. The quiet revelation (page 1)
2. The possibility (pages 2-3)
3. The creation (page 4)
4. The validation (page 5) ⭐ CRITICAL MOMENT
5. The momentum (pages 6-8)
6. The partnership (page 9) - Maya humanizes the journey
7. The understanding (pages 10-11)
8. The evolution (pages 12-13)
9. The cycle (pages 14-15) - full circle
