## Changes Made

### 1. Story Hook Updated ✅

**Before:**
> "Alex wakes up with an idea for modular terrariums and goes from concept to thriving business in eight months."

**After:**
> "Alex wakes up with an idea for modular terrariums. By the end of the same day, Woo helps them launch a live store. A vision of what's possible when infrastructure gets out of your way."

**Why:** Emphasizes the key hook—same-day launch from idea to live store. This is the compelling part that demonstrates the vision.

### 2. About Section Reframed ✅

**Before:**
> "A8C Stories is a collection of narratives exploring how Automattic's infrastructure enables creativity and entrepreneurship around the world."

**After:**
> "A8C Stories are vision narratives that explore what Automattic's products, services, and experiences could look like in the future.
>
> These aren't case studies or testimonials. They're aspirational stories designed to inspire shared visions we can work toward together—visions of WooCommerce, WordPress.com, Jetpack, and the open web at their best.
>
> By imagining what's possible, we create a shared understanding of where we're going."

**Why:** Clarifies these are **vision stories about the future**, not present-day case studies. They're aspirational, meant to inspire and align teams around shared goals.

## Key Messaging Changes

### Story Focus
**Old focus:** "Eight months to thriving business"
**New focus:** "Same-day launch with Woo's help"

The eight months is still part of the story (they grow to employees/subscribers), but the **hook** is the speed of getting started—idea to live store in one day.

### Project Purpose
**Old framing:** Stories about current infrastructure capabilities
**New framing:** Vision stories about future possibilities

This positions A8C Stories as:
- Forward-looking, not retrospective
- Aspirational, not documentary
- Alignment tools for teams working toward shared visions
- Inspiration for what we're building together

---

## Example Usage

**In conversations:**
> "These stories aren't about what exists today—they're visions of what we're working toward. The Terrarium Job imagines a future where Woo can help you go from idea to live store in a single day."

**For team alignment:**
> "This is the shared vision we're aiming for: infrastructure so good it becomes invisible. What would need to be true for this to be real?"

**For product teams:**
> "If this story feels like science fiction, that's the point. What can we build to make it feel obvious?"
