# Content Updates - January 13, 2026

## Changes Made

### 1. Story Hook Updated ✅

**Before:**
> "Alex wakes up with an idea for modular terrariums and goes from concept to thriving business in eight months."

**After:**
> "Alex wakes up with an idea for modular terrariums. By the end of the same day, Woo helps them launch a live store. A vision of what's possible when infrastructure gets out of your way."

**Why:** Emphasizes the key hook—same-day launch from idea to live store. This is the compelling part that demonstrates the vision.

---

### 2. About Section Reframed ✅

**Before:**
> "A8C Stories is a collection of narratives exploring how Automattic's infrastructure enables creativity and entrepreneurship around the world."

**After:**
> "A8C Stories are vision narratives that explore what Automattic's products, services, and experiences could look like in the future.
>
> These aren't case studies or testimonials. They're aspirational stories designed to inspire shared visions we can work toward together—visions of WooCommerce, WordPress.com, Jetpack, and the open web at their best.
>
> By imagining what's possible, we create a shared understanding of where we're going."

**Why:** Clarifies these are **vision stories about the future**, not present-day case studies. They're aspirational, meant to inspire and align teams around shared goals.

---

### 3. Navigation Link Added ✅

**Change:**
> Made "An A8C Story" subtitle clickable, linking back to the main library page

**Why:** Provides easy navigation between individual stories and the library index. Users can click the subtitle to return to browse other stories.

**Implementation:**
- Added link styling with subtle hover effects
- Links to `../` (parent directory)
- Maintains clean header design

---

### 4. GitHub Pages Deployment Fixed ✅

**Problem:** Images weren't loading on GitHub Pages due to path configuration issues.

**Root Cause:** GitHub Pages serves repo at `divydovy.github.io/a8cstories/`, not at domain root. Relative paths (`../../`) don't work correctly in this context.

**Solution:**
1. Changed GitHub Pages to serve from **root (/)** instead of `/docs`
2. Updated all image paths from relative to absolute:
   - Before: `../../01_the_terrarium_job/pages/page_01.png`
   - After: `/a8cstories/01_the_terrarium_job/pages/page_01.png`
3. Added root `index.html` that redirects to `/a8cstories/docs/`

**Result:** Site now fully functional at https://divydovy.github.io/a8cstories/

---

## Files Updated

- ✅ `docs/index.html` - Library page (story description, about section, absolute image paths)
- ✅ `docs/01-terrarium-job/index.html` - Story reader (about section, navigation link, absolute image paths)
- ✅ `index.html` - Root redirect to docs folder
- ✅ `README.md` - Project overview
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Exclude unwanted files
- ✅ `deploy.sh` - Quick deployment script

---

## Key Messaging Changes

### Story Focus
**Old focus:** "Eight months to thriving business"
**New focus:** "Same-day launch with Woo's help"

The eight months is still part of the story (they grow to employees/subscribers), but the **hook** is the speed of getting started—idea to live store in one day.

### Project Purpose
**Old framing:** Stories about current infrastructure capabilities
**New framing:** Vision stories about future possibilities

This positions A8C Stories as:
- Forward-looking, not retrospective
- Aspirational, not documentary
- Alignment tools for teams working toward shared visions
- Inspiration for what we're building together

---

## Example Usage

**In conversations:**
> "These stories aren't about what exists today—they're visions of what we're working toward. The Terrarium Job imagines a future where Woo can help you go from idea to live store in a single day."

**For team alignment:**
> "This is the shared vision we're aiming for: infrastructure so good it becomes invisible. What would need to be true for this to be real?"

**For product teams:**
> "If this story feels like science fiction, that's the point. What can we build to make it feel obvious?"

## Deployment

### ✅ Deployed to GitHub

**Repository:** https://github.com/divydovy/a8cstories
**Live Site:** https://divydovy.github.io/a8cstories/

### GitHub Pages Setup

1. Go to https://github.com/divydovy/a8cstories/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: **`/ (root)`** ← Important: Use root, not /docs
3. Click "Save"

**Why root?** Images are stored at project root (`01_the_terrarium_job/pages/`). Serving from root allows access to both `/docs/` pages and root-level assets.

Site will be live in 1-2 minutes.

### Future Updates

**Quick deploy:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Manual deploy:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```
