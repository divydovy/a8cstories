## Key Learnings

### What Worked in V2

✅ **Multi-panel layouts** - Proper comic book pacing
✅ **Character dialogue** - Shows personality and relationship dynamics
✅ **Maya addition** - Grounds the story, audience surrogate
✅ **Speech bubbles** - Traditional format makes it feel like a real comic
✅ **Emotional progression** - Joy, doubt, validation, growth visible through dialogue
✅ **Circular narrative** - Page 14-15 callback to Page 1 provides closure

### Technical Approach

- Keep prompts focused on panel content, not overly detailed
- Specify character consistency in each prompt
- Use clear panel descriptions (top wide, middle split, etc.)
- Neo-noir aesthetic works beautifully for comic book format
- Gemini handles multi-panel layouts surprisingly well

### Narrative Structure

- 15 pages provides good arc with breathing room
- 3-4 panels per page = natural reading rhythm
- Character introduction timing matters (Maya at midpoint perfect)
- External validation (reviews, Maya's perspective) crucial for credibility
- Epilogue panel provides perfect punctuation

---

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Standalone** - No context needed to understand story
✅ **Character Development** - Alex, Build, Maya all have arcs
✅ **Emotional Journey** - Excitement, validation, growth, satisfaction visible
✅ **Clear Value Prop** - WooCommerce benefits shown through story
✅ **Professional Format** - Traditional comic book structure
✅ **Satisfying Conclusion** - Circular narrative with growth
✅ **Rereadability** - Details reward multiple readings

## Feedback Questions

When reviewing with stakeholders:
1. Does the story make sense without additional context?
2. Do the characters feel real and relatable?
3. Are the emotional beats landing (especially first order)?
4. Is the WooCommerce value proposition clear?
5. Does the pacing work (too fast/too slow)?
6. Is Maya's role effective?
7. Does the ending satisfy?
8. Would you want to see Alex's next project?
