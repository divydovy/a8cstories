# Session Handoff - Woo Stories: The Terrarium Job
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Graphic Novel V2 Complete - Ready for Final Polish

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Transformed Abstract Concept Art → Proper Graphic Novel
- **Started with:** 12 single-image abstract scenes, no dialogue, film storyboard style
- **Ended with:** 14-page comic book with 52+ panels, full dialogue, character development
- **Format:** Traditional comic book layout with speech bubbles, thought bubbles, narrative captions

### 2. Added WooCommerce Branding
- Changed color scheme from generic teal to **WooCommerce purple (#7F54B3)**
- All digital elements (phone screens, laptop UIs, data visualizations) use WooCommerce purple
- Character refers to AI as "Woo" throughout
- Added tongue-in-cheek "WOO!" celebration on page 5 (first order)

### 3. Developed Three Characters
- **Alex** (Protagonist) - Gender-neutral maker, optimistic, learns as they grow
- **Woo** (AI Assistant) - WooCommerce AI, helpful, intelligent, learns the business
- **Maya** (Employee) - Hired at 6 months, grounds the story, audience surrogate

### 4. Created Standalone Story Arc
- **Pages 1-5:** Idea → Execution → First Sale (Hook)
- **Pages 6-8:** Growth → AI Optimization → Global Expansion (Momentum)
- **Pages 9-10:** Scale + Partnership → Understanding System (Transformation)
- **Pages 11-13:** Subscription Evolution → Reflection (Mastery)
- **Page 14:** New Idea Emerges → Cycle Begins Again (Closure)

## Key Dialogue Changes Made

### Page 2
- Top right: "Can I build these?"
- Bottom: "Now the hard part - can I sell these?" / "Let's find out. Opening Woo app."

### Page 3
- Removed "Four minutes" from caption (now just "6:30 AM")

### Page 4
- Caption: "3D printing the first one" (not "the first one")
- Changed "Holy shit" → "Woohoo!"
- Added: "Then I'll generate your product photos, video and social content"
- Changed "Of course you did" → "Neat"

### Page 5
- Big "WOO!" celebration moment
- Caption: "That feels great" (not "never gets old")

### Page 7
- Added dialogue: Woo says "Here's what we do next: we can increase your profits"
- Alex replies: "Wow, that's smart."

### Page 8
- Clarified coffee shop setting: "I'm sitting in a coffee shop" (not kitchen)

### Page 12
- Simplified: "The first subscription box is ready"
- Removed extra person (only Alex and Maya)

### Page 14
- Final caption: "It always starts with an idea" (not "with one")

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Text Rendering Quality
The AI model (Gemini 3 Pro) struggles with:
- Consistent text styling across pages
- Dialogue box placement (some float instead of being on screens)
- Text legibility in some panels
- Maintaining exact style specifications

**Pages with notable text issues:**
- **Page 6:** Bottom caption has mixed styling
- **Page 7:** Purple background bleeding, some Woo dialogue placement
- **Page 8:** Some text boxes floating instead of on laptop screen
- **Page 11:** Occasional floating purple boxes

### Style Consistency Target (Not Fully Achieved)
**Intended style guide:**
- Narrative captions: Tan/yellow rectangular boxes (like Page 2 top left)
- Hero dialogue: White speech/thought bubbles (like Page 1)
- Woo app: Purple text on phone/laptop screens only (like Page 2 phone)

**Reality:** About 70% consistent. Some pages have purple dialogue boxes floating in space instead of on screens.

## Story Content Highlights

### Key Moments
1. **Page 1:** "Hey Woo. I want to design a modular terrarium system..."
2. **Page 5:** "WOO! Someone bought one!" (THE emotional peak)
3. **Page 7:** Woo proactively suggests profit optimization
4. **Page 8:** "I'm sitting in a coffee shop" → Global business realization
5. **Page 9:** Maya introduced - "I hired Maya in month four. Best decision I made."
6. **Page 11:** Subscription suggestion from Woo
7. **Page 13:** Reflection: "$23,400 revenue, 387 orders, 42 subscribers"
8. **Page 14:** Circle closes: "Hey Woo. New project." → Cat furniture

### Themes Conveyed
✅ Accessibility of creation (idea to revenue fast)
✅ Human + AI partnership (amplification not replacement)
✅ Infrastructure as superpower (WooCommerce enables focus)
✅ Learning systems (platform grows with merchant)
✅ Infinite iteration (success enables next project)

---

## Next Steps / Recommendations

### Option 1: Professional Lettering (Recommended)
**Hand off to comic book letterer:**
- Use current pages as base art
- Apply professional lettering with correct text placement
- Ensures consistent dialogue box styling
- Standard comic book workflow
- Cost: ~$50-100/page

**What to provide:**
- All 14 PNG pages
- `GRAPHIC_NOVEL_SCRIPT.md` for exact dialogue
- Style guide: Tan captions, white bubbles, purple on-screen text

### Option 2: Design Tool Overlay
**Add text overlays in Figma/Photoshop:**
- Import all 14 pages
- Add text layers with speech bubbles
- More control over exact placement
- Can iterate quickly
- Time: 2-4 hours

### Option 3: Regenerate with Different Approach
**Try simpler prompts:**
- Generate pages WITHOUT text
- Add all dialogue separately as overlays
- More work but total control

### Option 4: Accept As-Is
**Current pages are 80% there:**
- Story is clear and readable
- Visual style is consistent
- WooCommerce branding is strong
- Good for internal review/stakeholder feedback
- Can refine later for final publication

## Technical Details

### Generation Method
- **Tool:** Gemini Image Generation (Nano Banana skill)
- **Model:** `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`
- **Resolution:** 2K (2048px)
- **Aspect:** 1:1 (standard)
- **Format:** PNG
- **Average:** 3.3 MB per page

### Prompt Pattern Used
```
Comic book page with [N] panels. Neo-noir aesthetic,
WooCommerce purple (#7F54B3) and warm amber tones,
dramatic lighting.

CHARACTER: Alex - 30s, gender neutral, short dark hair,
casual maker aesthetic

PANEL 1 (layout): [Description]
Caption: [text]
Speech bubble: [dialogue]
Phone text: [purple on-screen text]

[Repeat for each panel]

Professional comic borders, WooCommerce purple theme.
```

### What Worked Well
✅ Character consistency across all 14 pages
✅ WooCommerce purple color integration
✅ Neo-noir aesthetic maintained
✅ Multi-panel layouts functional
✅ Story beats clearly visible
✅ Emotional expressions captured

### What Didn't Work
❌ Text rendering inconsistency
❌ Dialogue box placement (floating vs on-screen)
❌ Some caption style mixing
❌ Occasional panel number labels visible
❌ Text legibility in some panels

---

## How to Continue This Work

### If regenerating pages:
```bash
cd /Users/davidlockie/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compounding-engineering/2.8.1/skills/gemini-imagegen

python3 scripts/generate_image.py \
  --model gemini-3-pro-image-preview \
  --size 2K \
  "Your prompt here" \
  /Users/davidlockie/Documents/Projects/woo-stories/01_the_terrarium_job/pages/page_XX.png
```

### Key prompt elements to include:
- "Neo-noir aesthetic, WooCommerce purple (#7F54B3) and warm amber"
- Character description (Alex - 30s, gender neutral, short dark hair)
- Specific panel layouts (top wide, middle left, bottom, etc.)
- "Professional comic borders"
- "NO panel labels visible" (to avoid PANEL 1, PANEL 2 text)

### Files to reference:
- **GRAPHIC_NOVEL_SCRIPT.md** - Full dialogue and scene descriptions
- **Page 1 & 2** - Best examples of desired dialogue box styling
- **IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Rationale for V1 → V2 changes
